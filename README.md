Sembryo
=======

Sembryo is nothing more than a boilerplate, a template, a seedwork, 
a default file structure from which to start a repository.
It aims to be the gold standard for file organization and project structuring.
We include the most common documentation files such as a code of conduct, 
contributing and supporting to have a top of the line repository structure 
from the begining and without the overhead of all the data retrival.

Do keep in mind that this is just the "embryo" of any project.
In reality, the evolution of the project as well as the frameworks
will most likely dictate the structure of the repository.
Consider this repo a startup-suggestion rather than a specific set of rules.
With that being said, we should clarify that the structured offered by *Sembryo*
does not focuses on any specific framework or language, instead it aims to
be an abstraction that wraps the actual contents of your repository.

Usage
-----
We are working towards providing a cli implementation that allows to 
easily initialize a new repository. For now, simply fork this repo,
remove the `.git` directory and change this `README.md` to describe your repo.

Not sure how to write a `README.md`? 
Take a look at [this](https://www.makeareadme.com/) awesome page.
